refer Image -> postgresql_architecture

There is a postmaster process which is like init process of linux.
This process owns all the other user and 
utility processes like : Auto vacuum, Stats collector, Check Pointer, WAL writer, Log writer.

as well as the connections which are made to the postgresql.


In the Memory Component there is a shared memory defined for postmaster process, in this shared memory you have 

Shared Buffers
===============
Shared Buffer -> stores the cache pages from tables and indexes.
The data is read from data files into File System cache and then put inside shared buffer.


WAL Buffers
=============
There is a memory segment called WAL Buffers which caches the WAL records, as soon as you commit your transaction , these wall buffers are flushed to the File Sysytem cache and then flushed to WAL files on the disk.



work_mem
=========
There are temporary files which are used for sorting and in addition to having temporary files to speed up the sort process there is a sorting space in the memory which is called work memory.


maintainence_work_mem
=======================
There is separate segment used for maintainence work ( Like: Indexig , creation of FKs ).
This area is called maintainence memotry or maintainence work memory.




How things work is data is cached into shared buffer and then data is returned to user from shared Buffers.
