\d  				=>	listing all relations  
\dt					=>	list only all tables
\d relation_name	=>	Describe a specific relation
\x auto				=>	formatting output
\o file_name		=>	want to open your results in your editor or a 								spreadsheet for further analysis,
						\o data redirect all output to the file ./file_name, where "." is present working directory.
						Note that data might also be a script that accepts query results on standard input.

for CSV generation
==================
after "\o filename" do

\f ','			=>	set the field separator to ,
\a 				=>	switch to unaligned output mode 
\t 				=>	show tuples but no headers or footers


Declare Variables
=================

\set t my_long_table_name
select count(*) from :t;



Pagination of output
====================

\pset pager off 	=>	disable pagination 


psql will page through the query results using $PAGER, usually defaulting to more,If you prefer less use


\setenv PAGER less



Change Table Styles
===================


\pset format wrapped		=> to prevent your columns from running wider than
								your screen.

\pset border 0				=> turn off borders
\pset border 2				=> add more borders

\pset linestyle 	unicode    => use unicode characters to draw borders



Changing the PROMPT1
====================
There are a lot of options for changing the prompt. You can add colors, domain names, the name of the current database, and more.


\set PROMPT1 '%[%033[1m%]%M %n@%/%R%[%033[0m%]%#'

%[..%]					=>	 default prompt color to a bold black.
%M 						=>	 host name
%n  					=> 	 database user name
%/						=>	 database name
%R 						=>   normally =, but ^ if in single-line mode, and ! 							if the session is disconnected from the database
%[...%]					=> resets the color to non-bold black
%#						=> # if you’re a superuser, otherwise >



Changing the PROMPT2
=====================
PROMPT2 is used when psql is waiting for more input, like when you type SELECT * FROM then hit enter - you haven’t typed a semicolon, so psql patiently displays PROMPT2 and waits.


\set PROMPT2 '[more] %R > '


[more] 					=> is the literal string [more].
%R 						=> 




~/.psqlrc
==========

-- By default, NULL displays as an empty space. Is it actually an empty
-- string, or is it null? This makes that distinction visible.

\pset null '[NULL]'

-- Use table format (with headers across the top) by default, but switch to
-- expanded table format when there's a lot of data, which makes it much
-- easier to read.

\x auto

-- Verbose error reports.

\set VERBOSITY verbose

-- Use a separate history file per-database.

\set HISTFILE ~/.psql_history- :DBNAME

-- If a command is run more than once in a row, only store it once in the
-- history.

\set HISTCONTROL ignoredups

-- Autocomplete keywords (like SELECT) in upper-case, even if you started
-- typing them in lower case.

\set COMP_KEYWORD_CASE upper

\set PROMPT1 '%[%033[1m%]%M %n@%/%R%[%033[0m%]%#'

\set PROMPT2 '[more] %R > '

\pset border 2

\pset format wrapped

\pset linestyle unicode
