Linux Configuration
===================
1). turn OFF the OOM killer.
2).use file system as ext4 or XFS ( by default it will be ext3)
3).set two kernal parameters need to be set  , search in postgres documentation how to set
	shared memory maximum : SHMMAX
	shared memory All : SHMALL




you can use pgbench utility to insert sample data.

I am runnign something in the background on these tables and v gona check how the things works

There is some query runnig slower in ur environment n, u have 2 figure out which is that query and from which terminal/application it has been fired


one of the easiest way to do that is to use "pg_stat_activity" table

\dS+ pg_stat_activity

 datid      			=> oid of that database where this query is running
 datname    			=>  this particular session is related to which database   
 pid        			=> OS process which is running for that particular query   
 usesysid  			    =>  
 usename  			    =>    
 application_name 		=>
 client_addr  			=>  from where the query has been fired  
 client_hostname 		=>  
 client_port   			=>   
 
 backend_start   		=> when your connection started
 xact_start     		=> what was the time when ur transaction started, the moment u say begin transaction there will be timestamp marked for this column
 query_start     		=> there is a query running , and the time it sarted
 state_change     		=>
 
 waiting          		=> this gives us information, if ur query is waiting for certain locks
 state       			=> if ur query is curently running or ur transaction is in idle state u will see that here


Will list all the things running on my database
===============================================
Ravi=#	select * from pg_stat_activity ;


select datname,application_name,current_timestamp-query_start,query_start,query from pg_stat_activity where state!='idle';

gives u slowest 5 running queries
==================================
select * from (select datname,application_name,current_timestamp-query_start "duration",query_start,query from pg_stat_activity where state='active')a order by "duration" desc limit 5;
