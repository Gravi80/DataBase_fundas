The Commit Log(Clog) is what postgres uses to track whether a transaction is commited or rollback or still in-progress.

MultiTransactions(multiXacts) stores information about row-level locks, updates and deletes when multiple transactions are involved.

Vaccum is responsible for removing unnecessary data from CLOG and multiXacts.
