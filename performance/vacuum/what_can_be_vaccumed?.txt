You do an update or delete you are creating these dead rows, but the big questions becomes when you have a dead row when can you actually remove that.

Basically the constraint there is that when you start a transaction or select statement.
In postgres the database gets help of the snapshot and that snapshot has visibilty information that determins what rows that statement can actually see.
So, if u have a snapshot in ur database taken an hour ago and since that snapshot have deleted 4 millions rows those rows can't be cleaned up by vaccum bcz that hour old select statement could still need to look at that data.

i.e Vacuum can only removes rows that no currently running transaction could see.



Because of how Index Scan and Sequential scan operates you cannot vacuum a page of data while somebody else is looking at that page.
