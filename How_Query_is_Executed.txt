when you run any SQL ->
checks

1). Syntax
2). Semantics + authorization  => whether i am properly following the semantics of language   
3). Expanding the Query  =>  * will become  id,name,salary    
4). Find The Execution Plan (with index,without index) (generate shortest-path algorithm)
5).	Choose the best execution plans
6). Execute + Check Constraints 
7). Fetch Results

    These steps are called Parsing Algorithm.
    and This is called as Hard Parse.



After execution of query for first time
Query and Best Execution Plan will be cached in db_buffer . So, next time it will just find in the memory that the Query exists and find the best execution plan of query present in the the buffer and execute the query.


This is called Soft Parse.
