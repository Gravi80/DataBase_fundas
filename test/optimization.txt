=> Try to avoid nested loops
=> Driving table should be table which is having low number of rows.
=> Try to do filter condition before joins.

Select * from emp INNER JOIN Dept
ON Emp.dept_no = Dept.dept_no
Where emp.name = ‘A’;

In above Emp.dept_no and Dept.dept_no , columns should be indexed.
But emp.name = ‘A’ -> will gives you Less Result.


You can write above as 
---------------------------
Select * from (select * from Emp Where Name=‘A’) a INNER JOIN Dept
ON a.dept_no =  Dept.dept_no;



This will perform Better
---------------------------
Select * from Emp,Dept where Dept.dept_no=Emp.dept_no;
